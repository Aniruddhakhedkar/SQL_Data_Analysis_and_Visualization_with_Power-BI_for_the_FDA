Different types of Appltype-
N: This type typically refers to a New Drug Application (NDA). An NDA is a formal proposal made by a pharmaceutical company to the FDA for the review and approval of a new drug product. It includes comprehensive data on the drug's chemistry, manufacturing, pharmacology, clinical trials, and proposed labeling.
A: This type typically refers to an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An ANDA is a submission to the FDA for the review and approval of a generic drug product. Unlike an NDA, an ANDA relies on the safety and efficacy data of a previously approved
brand-name drug (reference listed drug).
B: This type typically refers to a Biologics License Application (BLA). A BLA is a submission to the FDA for the review and approval of a biological product. Biological products include vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins.

Different type of Actiontype-
AP: This action type likely stands for "Approval." It indicates that the FDA has approved the application for the drug or biological product. Once an application receives approval, the product can be marketed and sold to consumers.
TA: This action type may stand for "Therapeutic Area." It could indicate that the application is related to a specific therapeutic area or medical specialty. However, without further context or information, the exact meaning of this action type may vary.

Different Product Market Status
1 - Marketed: Products with this status are currently on the market and available for sale to consumers. They have completed regulatory approvals and are actively marketed and distributed by the manufacturer or sponsor. These products are typically sold in pharmacies, hospitals, or other healthcare settings.
2 - Withdrawn: Products with this status have been withdrawn or removed from the market. This withdrawal could be voluntary by the manufacturer due to safety concerns, lack of effectiveness, or commercial reasons. Regulatory agencies could also mandate it due to safety issues or non-compliance with regulations.
3 - Pending: Products with this status are pending regulatory approval or undergoing review by regulatory agencies. They have yet to receive market authorization and are not available for sale to consumers. This status indicates that the product is under regulatory review and may require additional data or information before approval.
4 - Pre-Market: Products with this status are in the pre-market phase, meaning they are not yet available for sale but are in development or awaiting regulatory approval. They may be undergoing clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up, or regulatory submissions. This status indicates that the product is being prepared for market launch in the future.
