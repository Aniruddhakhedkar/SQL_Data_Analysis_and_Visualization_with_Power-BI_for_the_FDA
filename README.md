# Project Title:- SQL Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI for the U.S. Food & Drug Administration Agency (FDA)

### Project Description:- 

The project deals with the analysis of U.S. FDA data, to identify a detailed approval trends and segmentation analysis based on drug marketing status using SQL. This analysis delves into product identification, therapeutic classes, and evolving approval patterns.

Firstly, data is retrieved from SQL to capture essential insights (Task-1). Next, Power BI is employed to create intuitive dashboards that effectively visualize these findings (Task-2).

### Tools/Software:-SQL, Power BI, and Microsoft PowerPoint

### Tasks/Objectives:-

##### Part - 1 SQL Queries:

Task 1: Identifying Approval Trends
1. Determine the number of drugs approved each year and provide insights into the yearly trends.
2. Identify the top three years that got the highest and lowest approvals, in descending and ascending order, respectively.
3. Explore approval trends over the years based on sponsors. 
4. Rank sponsors based on the total number of approvals they received each year between 1939 and 1960.

Task 2: Segmentation Analysis Based on Drug MarketingStatus
1. Group products based on MarketingStatus. Provide meaningful insights into the segmentation patterns.
2. Calculate the total number of applications for each MarketingStatus year-wise after the year 2010. 
3. Identify the top MarketingStatus with the maximum number of applications and analyze its trend over time.

Task 3: Analyzing Products
1. Categorize Products by dosage form and analyze their distribution.
2. Calculate the total number of approvals for each dosage form and identify the most successful forms.
3. Investigate yearly trends related to successful forms. 

Task 4: Exploring Therapeutic Classes and Approval Trends
1. Analyze drug approvals based on therapeutic evaluation code (TE_Code).
2. Determine the therapeutic evaluation code (TE_Code) with the highest number of Approvals in each year.

#### Part - 2 Power BI Visualizations:

1) Visualize the yearly approval trends of drugs. Highlight any significant patterns and/or fluctuations, if any.
2) Explore approval trends over the years based on different sponsors. Uncover patterns and changes in approval rates among sponsors.
3) Visualize the segmentation of products based on MarketingStatus. 
4) Show the total number of applications for each MarketingStatus. Enable users to filter by years and MarketingStatus for detailed analysis.
5) Analyze the grouping of drugs by dosage form. Visualize the distribution of approvals across different forms. Identify the most successful dosage form.
6) Visualize drug approvals based on therapeutic classes. Identify classes with the highest number of approvals.

### Findings-

1) Total no of applications from drug sponsors for drugs and their rate of approval from FDA end is also increasing, till 2002.
2) Post 2002, there is a sudden decrease in the total no of applications and approvals from FDA.
3) After Mid 1985â€™s there can be seen a rise in drug approval application, for specific therapeutic area. 
4) More no of applicants can be seen applying to receive drug approvals.
5) Low & Mid dosage drugs are likely to get fast approvals from FDA.
6) AB, AP, and the AA are the therapeutic classes which had received highest no of approvals. 
7) Tablet Form of drug and Oral-Type of dosage, had received highest approvals.
8) Most of the products were in the state of being marketed or in the state of pending.
